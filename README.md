# 🚀 Idea-to-Post AI

A simple AI-powered tool that turns **one idea** into multiple platform-ready posts in seconds.

Instead of rewriting content manually for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, or developer platforms — this tool generates optimized versions automatically.

One input → Multiple platform-optimized posts ⚡  
Simple. Fast. Creator-first.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As a builder and content creator, rewriting the same idea for different platforms felt repetitive.

So I built my own solution to:

- Save time
- Reduce manual rewriting
- Maintain platform-specific tone
- Improve content consistency

This project helped me understand prompt structuring, response formatting, and AI-based content workflows.
